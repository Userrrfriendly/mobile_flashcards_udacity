Mobile FlashCards is a project for Udacity React NanoDegree.

It's is a mobile application that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app allows users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks. To see the answer to each question the user simply needs to tap on the question card. After answering all the questions in the quiz a new screen pops up that displays the number of correct answers.

⚠️ **Although the app can run on both IOS/Android, no UI optimizations were made for IOS, so Android is the prefered platform.**  

In order to run the project locally clone this repo and run `npm install` to setup the project.
After the installation run `npm start` to kick off the dev server. To view the app on a real device, install *expo* app on your mobile phone and simply scan the QR code.

That's all!
